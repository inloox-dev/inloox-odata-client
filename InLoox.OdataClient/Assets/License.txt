The Software shall always remain the intellectual property of InLoox and/or the respective right owner.

(9) In the event that the Software is used in a network the Customer must ensure that there is a License for each data processing unit and/or each named user having access to the server and the possibility to use the Software.

Copyright notes must not be deleted, changed or suppressed. The Customer may exclusively use the Software for each license on a standalone computer, no matter if it is a workstation, notebook or PDA except in such cases where he purchases a network license. The use of the Software also implies loading the Software into the temporary memory of a computer or similar object or installing the Software on a permanent storage medium (e.g. hard disk, DVD, CD-ROM, or similar). However, the Parties may come to differently worded agreements in an individual Agreement issued in writing.

(3) A user manual and any other documents possibly provided by InLoox may only be copied for the company’s internal purposes.

(4) The Customer shall not be entitled to transfer the Software without the written consent of InLoox; this applies in particular in the event of sale. InLoox shall agree to the passing-on of the Software (in whole or in part) to a third party under the following conditions:

§ 5 Obligations of the Customer

(1) In the event that you are a business owner you undertake to inspect all delivery items of InLoox immediately upon receipt of the goods in accordance with the regulations of commercial law (§ 377 of the German Commercial Code) and to make complaints in respect of defects with an exact description of the defect, submitted in writing. Each Customer is obliged to test all modules with regard to usability in the concrete situation before starting any operative use. This also applies to programs the Customer receives in the context of supplementary performance or a possible maintenance agreement.

(2) The Customer shall take adequate precautions to counter situations where the program does not operate properly in whole or in part (e.g. by data backup, error diagnosis, regular check on the results). The Customer shall be responsible for ensuring the operation of the working environment of the program. He shall be obliged to carry out the necessary adjustments to his firewall, virus scanners or similar data protection mechanisms in his network as well as his server. InLoox shall not bear the risk of incompatibility of the Software with the software or hardware used by the Customer.

(3) You shall not be entitled to use or modify the logo and/or trademarks of InLoox unless the company management of InLoox has given its prior agreement to the use or modification of the logo in writing.

(4) Subject to the provisions of § 69 e German Copyright Act (UrhG) you may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software.

(5) You undertake to indemnify and defend InLoox from all claims of third parties, including reasonable lawyers’ fees arising or resulting from any use of this Software against the agreement.

§ 6 Warranty

(1) Delivered Software possesses the agreed-upon characteristics, is suitable for the applications assumed by the contract and which are otherwise standard, and has usual quality of software of this type. Not every flaw which is connected with the Software is a defect which implies warranty rights. An impairment in the Software’s functioning which results from hardware defects, environmental conditions, improper operation and the like, is not a defect. An insignificant deterioration in quality will not be taken into account. InLoox guarantees that no rights of third parties are violated through the use of the Software by the Customer in accordance with the provisions of the contract.

(2) Customers who are consumers within the meaning of § 13 German Civil Code (BGB) have in respect to defects of the purchased good the rights set out in the German Civil Code (BGB). In case that a consumer is entitled to claim damages hereafter, § 7 applies accordingly.

(3) In all other cases of liability for defects the following terms apply:

(a) InLoox may first attempt to remedy any material defects. InLoox may choose to remedy the defect by eliminating it, i.e. also by demonstrating possibilities by means of which the effects of the defect can be avoided, or through delivery of a program which does not contain the defect. An equivalent new program version or the equivalent previous program version which had not contained the faults is to be accepted by the Customer, when this is reasonable. In the case of defects in title, InLoox shall give the assurance that it will provide the Customer with legally unchallengeable option to use either the Software or equivalent software, at its option.

(b) The Customer shall support InLoox in the analysis of faults and removal of defects by specifically describing problems which occur, providing InLoox with complete information and granting it the necessary time and opportunities to remove the defect. InLoox may also remove the defect on-site or at its place of business, at its discretion. The performance of InLoox may also take the form of remote maintenance. The Customer must ensure the necessary technical prerequisites at his own expense and, after due prior notification, provide InLoox with access to his computer equipment.

(c) InLoox may levy additional charges, when the Software is modified, employed outside the environment provided for or incorrectly operated. It may demand compensation if no defect is found or if it is incorrectly/insufficiently informed of a fault. The burden of proof lies with the Customer in accordance with § 254 German Civil Code (BGB).

(d) If InLoox ultimately refuses to remedy the defect, if it ultimately is unsuccessful or if this is unreasonable for the Customer, he may withdraw in writing from the contract or correspondingly curtail the payment and in accordance with § 7 demand damages or reimbursement of expenses.

(e) Insofar as the above has not been otherwise agreed, further liability on the part of InLoox within the meaning of liability for defects is excluded. In particular, liability for defects does not apply if and to the extent that the Software is improperly used by the Customer or used in a defective or incompatible hardware or software environment. The same applies in the event that the Customer undertakes unauthorized modifications of the Software.

(g) The statute of limitation for claims for defects is one year as of the statutory commencement of the limitation period.

§ 7 Liability

The following limitations of liability apply in case of claims for damages of the Customer arising from liability for defects or from any other reasons:

(1) InLoox is liable for intent and gross negligence in accordance with the statutory provisions. The same applies to injury of life, body or health as well as to claims arising from warranties or from the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz, ProdHaftG).

(2) Moreover, InLoox is only liable for culpably infringing contractual obligations the fulfilment of which renders a correct execution of the contract possible, and the Customer can always trust on said material obligations being observed (cardinal obligation). This includes, in particular, the obligation to fulfil a performance free from defects. In this case InLoox’s liability is limited to the loss or damage foreseeable upon conclusion of the contract.

(3) A further liability of InLoox is excluded.

(4) Should the liability for damages on the part of InLoox be excluded or reduced, this shall also apply with regard to personal liability for compensation for damages on the part of its employees, representatives and persons employed in auxiliary tasks.

(5) The right to contest the charge of contributory negligence remains open to InLoox. It is pointed out to the Customer that, within the framework of his obligation to exercise diligence, before using the Software for the first time, he must test whether the installation of the Software might lead to particular interference with pre-installed software, and that he must further ensure back-up of his data before the first installation as well as during the course of operations and, in the case of a suspected fault in the Software, that he implements all additional reasonable measures required for security.

(6) The statute of limitation for claims of the client who is not a consumer is one year as of the statutory commencement of the limitation period.

(7) The conditions of this paragraph apply mutatis mutandis to component manufacturers of the Software.

§ 8 Software Updates and Upgrades

At the sole discretion of InLoox, users may be provided with updates and upgrades to the Software. InLoox retains the right to provide upgrades for a fee. Upon installation of an upgrade, users shall not use, separate or transfer the previous version to a third party separately. Unless InLoox provides other terms and conditions with an update or upgrade, the terms and conditions of this EULA shall continue to apply. Users may refuse to accept an update or upgrade. However, upon release of an update or upgrade, InLoox may have no further obligation to support the previous version.

§ 9 Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)

As part of the “Customer Experience Improvement Program” (CEIP), InLoox will gather anonymized usage statistics and error reports. Customer can turn off this feature at any time. More information can be found at www.inloox.com/ceip.

§ 10 Start and End of the Customer’s Rights

(1) The ownership of the supplied items and the rights in accordance with § 2 and § 3 shall not be transferred to the Customer until complete payment of the purchase price. Before that, he only has a preliminary right of use in accordance with the law of obligations, revocable in accordance with § 10 (2).

(2) InLoox shall be entitled to revoke the rights in accordance with § 2 and § 3 for important reasons, in particular for the reasons specified in § 3 of the General Terms of Business of InLoox or to terminate the Agreement respectively. An important reason particularly exists if the Customer does not effect the due payment, if he continues to infringe the obligations under § 2 and § 3 of this Agreement in a substantial way, despite written reminders, or in the event that a petition of bankruptcy has been filed in respect of the Customer’s assets.

(3) If the right of use in accordance with § 3 in conjunction with § 2 does not occur or if it should end, InLoox shall be entitled to demand from the Customer the return of the provided goods or demand a written assurance that they have been destroyed and that all copies have been destroyed, along with the written assurance that this has been effected.

§ 11 Secrecy, Data Protection

(1) The Contracting Parties undertake to treat all objects they receive from the other Contracting Party or objects they gain knowledge of (e.g. software, documents, information) which are legally protected, contain business or company secrets or are designated as confidential, confidentially - even beyond the expiration of the Agreement, unless these objects are publicly known without any infringement of the obligation of secrecy. The Contracting Parties shall store and save these objects in such a way that any unauthorized access by third parties is excluded.

(2) The Customer permits access to the subjects of the Agreement only by his personnel or third parties requiring access in order to perform their assigned tasks. He shall inform these persons about the need for these objects to be kept confidential.

(3) The Parties have agreed on a Data Processing Agreement, which builds the legal framework for all processing of personal data within the use of the Software provided.

§ 12 Applicable law, legal venue

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany under exclusion of the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and international law (in particular German laws of conflict).

As far as the customer is not a consumer in the sense of § 13 BGB, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract including its appendices is Munich. The same applies if the customer has no general place of jurisdiction in Germany or his place of residence or usual abode is not known at the time the action is filed.

§ 13 Safeguarding Clause

If any provision of this Agreement should be or become invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement even if essential provisions are concerned. The Parties agree to replace the invalid provision by a legally effective regulation which comes as closest to the contractually stipulated legal and economic intent of the invalid provision and ensures the operability of the Agreement in the sense of what both Parties had intended. The same shall apply in the event that the Parties have not discovered a gap in the provisions at the time the Agreement was concluded or if such a gap becomes known or occurs later. In that case, the Parties shall be obliged to generate a written supplement to the Agreement in the sense of the aforementioned.
